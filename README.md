Welcome to the Send Email Simulator!

This project is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to simulate sending emails. It is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.

To use the simulator, simply enter the recipient's email address, subject, and message in the provided fields and click the "Send" button. The simulator will then display a confirmation message indicating that the email has been sent.

Please note that the simulator does not actually send any emails. It is a simulation only.

The project is open source and available on GitHub. Feel free to clone or download the code and use it as a starting point for your own projects.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub.

Thank you for using the Send Email Simulator!
